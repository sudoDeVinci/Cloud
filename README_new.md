# Cloud Detection & Tracking using the Visual Colour Space: Concept Exploration

##Concept
Quick yet accurate Weather prediction is imperative for certain industries to now only survive,
but simply exist. An important factor of these is the ability to track, categorize and predict
movements of clouds within a given area. Ceilometers use a laser/light source to determine a
cloud's base or ceiling height. A Ceilometer usually can also measure aerosol concentration in
air [1]. The downside is that ceilometers have a relatively small area of measurement directly
above the unit which would not be an issue, however, as of 2020 they can cost around USD
$30 000 per unit [3].
There exists however, high quality satellite data made available by NASA. The new MISR Level
2 Cloud product contains height-resolved, cloud motion vectors at 17.6 km resolution; cloud top
heights at 1.1 km resolution; and cross-track cloud motion components at 1.1 km resolution [2].
Now this data is made available to be used by software engineers to visualize as needed. The
issue? This data is not meant for real-time application on a local area level. These products are
made for global application, collecting data only on the sunlit side of earth over the course of 9
days [4].
A better solution for the local-area level must be thought of then, to better predict cloud
movement and category.
